Hii Everyone,
As all of us know Bangalore is a Metropolitan city and it is also know as silicon valley of India.
The traffic in the Bangalore is heavy. if we stuck in that traffic it is very difficult to reach destination
on time. To avoid that we need to start early. we can also use metro or rapido bikes.



Thank you for giving this opportunity.
